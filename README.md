## Quantum Programming Background
Quantum programming is the practice of writing algorithms and software that operate on quantum computers, differing from classic computers. Classic computers process information in bits that represent either a 0 or a 1. In contrast, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously due to quantum superposition. This ability allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classic computers.

## Development of Quantum Programming Languages
The development of quantum programming languages started with early theoretical explorations in quantum logic and computation. Influential early works include Peter Selinger's exploration of quantum semantics and syntax, which laid foundational principles for quantum programming by adapting classic concepts such as lambda calculus and linear logic to the quantum realm.

## Subfields of Quantum Programming Languages
* Formal Semantics and Logic: Key contributions came from formal methods like lambda calculus and linear logic, which were adapted to handle quantum operations. These foundations helped in developing languages like QML and QCL, which introduced type systems and operational semantics specifically tailored for quantum computing.

* Quantum Circuit and Compiler Design: Compiler optimizations, especially those focusing on gate synthesis and error correction, have played a crucial role. For example, the Quipper language emphasizes scalability and expressiveness for practical quantum circuits, addressing issues like gate optimization and hardware independence​.

* Quantum Algorithm Design: Quantum languages often incorporate constructs directly suited to popular quantum algorithms. For instance, high-level constructs in Quipper and Q# allow for easy implementation of algorithms like Grover’s search or quantum Fourier transforms, which are core components of many quantum applications.

## Influential Researchers and Their Impact
* Peter Selinger: A prominent figure in quantum programming, Selinger's work on semantics and type systems for quantum computation has deeply influenced the field.
* Vladimir Kliuchnikov, Dmitri Maslov, and Michele Mosca: Known for their contributions to quantum circuit synthesis and optimization, their research has enhanced the practical aspects of quantum programming by making quantum circuits more efficient and accessible​.
* Mingsheng Ying: An authority on quantum logic and program verification, Ying has contributed significantly to the formal methods for reasoning about quantum programs, ensuring correctness and reliability​.

## Key Works and Resources
* Quipper: A Scalable Quantum Programming Language: Quipper is widely recognized for its ability to handle complex quantum computations, making it one of the most practical languages for large-scale quantum algorithms. It emphasizes the importance of hardware abstraction and efficient error management, which is crucial for real-world quantum applications​.
